## Description

Simple data science problem that focuses and visualizing and analyzing the dataset from the Kaggle Titanic competition.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3
* git

### Setup

* Download the `train.csv` file from the [Kaggle Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview) competition
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required Python packages:

## Objectives
Visualize the data and analyze correlations using Python with your choice of libraries, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scipy`.

### Visualize Data

* Sex and Survival: Bar charts to compare survival rates by gender.
* Age and Survival: Histograms and density plots to show age distribution among survivors and non-survivors.
* Class and Survival: Bar charts for survival rates across passenger classes.

### Analyze Correlations

* Examine survival trends by sex, age, and passenger class.
* Use statistical methods to identify significant relationships.
